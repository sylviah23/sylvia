As someone with frustratingly dry, frizzy hair, I fell deep into the rabbit hole of hair care and wavy hair products over the summer. When trying to find the best hair products for me, one thing that was stressed again and again was that certain ingredients were better for certain hair types and more importantly, certain other ingredients could have devastating effects on someone's hair. When considering product recommendations, I wanted to have an easy way to look up the ingredients for that product, which was the inspriation for this project. 

The data used in this project was obtained through web scraping ulta.com's hair care products using selenium. Product names, brands, purchasing link, and ingredients list for 600+ hair care products were acquired and added to a csv file. The Python code used in the web scraping and the corresponding csv file can both be found under the "web scrape" folder. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were then used to create an interactive website where users select a brand and are then taken to a page featuring the products and its ingredients for that brand. D3.js was used to provide the website with data from the csv file. Finally, Tableau was used to create various data visualizations, which were subsequently added to the website's stats page.
